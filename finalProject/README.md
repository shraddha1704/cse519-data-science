# CSE 519 Final Project
## Public Notice Analysis

Legal notices (also known as public notices) are advertisements which by law must be published in newspapers, to inform the public about activities and events which are of importance to the community. There are differences that vary by state and local law, but generally legal notices describe government/public hearings, building permit requests, corporate and personal name changes, sales or purchases of government properties, and sales of foreclosed property.

We have obtained a dataset of millions of public notices, from a variety of states spanning over ten years.The purpose of the project is to analyze data contained within public legal notices with the aim of finding a definite correlation between  socio-economic forces affecting communities. Apart from social trend analysis, the project aims to perform cluster analysis on the public notices to group the notices in different categories. The topics obtained on performing Cluster analysis need to be evaluated by inspecting items in addition to any statistical measure, to understand how good the clusters are.
